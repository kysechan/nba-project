# Getting Mongo working with Data:
1. Download mongo db volume from here:
    1. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J7lcHTjlDeZyeXdaP5C21VQUcboC3ide/view?usp=sharing
    2. Unzip into nba-project dir
    3. Make sure folder is called nba-mongo
2. Make sure you have docker installed and running
3. Run ./start-mongo.sh
4. Should now be accessible under this uri:
    1. mongodb://localhost:27017
5. To view the data using a GUI I would recommend compass:
    1. https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass
